How to use the HFDB
===================

The *Hardware Forensic Database* provides information about:

* IoT-related forensic methodologies and tools
* Off-the-shelf devices: smartlocks, healthcare devices, ...
* Electronic chips generally used in embedded devices: MCUs, CPUs, SoCs

-------------------------------
Specific Forensic Methodologies
-------------------------------

The *Hardware Forensic Database* contains information about various devices (see :doc:`devices`), detailing how to handle them
and more importantly how to collect and interpret valuable information.

Moreover, we provide an IoT-related forensic methodology you may want to follow in order to collect, preserve and investigate smart/connected objects.

The search box at the top-left corner of this website is a good way to quickly find information about a specific device.


-----------------------
Specific Forensic Tools
-----------------------

We also develop `specific tools <https://github.com/digitalsecurity/hfdb.io/tools/>`_ required to automate collection and extraction for some specific devices or file format, these tools
are part of this project and available in our Github repository. They are usually referenced in methodologies and may be found very quickly.
