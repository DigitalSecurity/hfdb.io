Features
--------

The CC254x SoCs are 2.4GHz Bluetooth and Proprietary RF protocol System-on-Chips. They are widely used
in various products that require efficient RF communications (Nordic ESB/SB, Bluetooth Low Energy, or other proprietary protocols).

It includes:

  * 128 or 256 Kbytes of flash memory (depending on the version)
  * 8 Kbytes of RAM with retention
  * AES security coprocessor
  * 2 USART ports
  * I2C interface

Firmware extraction
-------------------

The only way to extract a firmware from a CC2541 is to use Texas Instruments CC Debugger. This debugger must be connected to the hardware debug pointerType
in order to access the Flash and extract its content. The software used is for Windows only, but may also work in a virtual machine on a Linux host.

Connecting the CC debugger to CC254x
------------------------------------

The minimal viable connection for the CC debugger to work with the CC254x SoC is the following:

.. image:: ../../images/debuggers/ccdebugger/connect-8051.png

.. note:: the resistors and capacitors added above are optional

On a Windows machine, start the Flash Programmer application as administrator and connect to the target SoC. The Target SoC MUST be
visible in the System-on-Chip area.

1. Select a target directory and file name for your flash dump
2. In the Actions frame, select *Read flash into hex-file*
3. Click the *Perform Actions* button, the dump should start

Converting the hex file into a binary file
------------------------------------------

The best way is to use Linux' *objcopy* utility:

.. code-block:: text

    $ objcopy -I ihex -O binary <input hex filename> <output raw binary filename>

-----------------
Memory Protection
-----------------

Texas Instruments CC254x SoCs may be protected against firmware extraction even with the debugging interface
enabled. The SoC uses a 16-byte long structure to define many *lock bits*, including the *DBGLOCK* (bit 127).
If this bit is set to 0, then accessing the flash memory through debugging is forbidden, and the SoC has to
be erased to reset this bit, causing the flash memory to be erased.

A READ_STATUS command issued on the debugging interface provides information about the state of this lock bit (bit 2 of the READ_STATUS response).
