Welcome to the Hardware Forensic Database!
======================================================

What is the Hardware Forensic Database ?
----------------------------------------

The *Hardware Forensic Database* (or HFDB) is a project of CERT-UBIK aiming at providing a collaborative
knowledge base related to IoT Forensic methodologies and tools.

This database provides multiple guides to collect valuable information from various smart/connected devices, as well
as dedicated tools. These guides allows quick information extraction and provides all the required material to perform
a forensic analysis on specific devices.

How to contribute
-----------------

If you want to contribute to this project, i.e. add information about a specific device and how to forensically handle it or even
add an IoT-oriented forensic tool, feel free to clone `this repository <https://github.com/digitalsecurity/hfdb.io>`_ and submit a Pull Request.
